# ChatRatReact
### This is a closer to what one would like to make while creating a chat app. It has options to create multiple private chat rooms as well as join them. One person can only join one room from a tab. Open another tab to join another room. The backend is made using socket.io 2.0 in node.js. The frontend is made using react.js unlike the previous iteration which was pure html,css and javascript. This one utilises react-redux, react-router also to implement the new features. All the frontend is served via webpack dev server.
